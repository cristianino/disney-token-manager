# Disney Token Manager with ERC-20 (no-official)

## Introduction

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Disney Token Manager using the ERC-20 standard on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract allows the creation, activation, and deactivation of attractions in a Disney theme park, as well as facilitating payments for food and providing a client's transaction history. The contract utilizes modifiers for implementing access control and events to emit information about attraction and food-related activities.

## ERC-20 Token

The smart contract implements the ERC-20 standard, which is a widely adopted token standard on the Ethereum blockchain. It ensures that the Disney tokens have a consistent interface, allowing them to be managed and traded on various decentralized applications (DApps) and exchanges that support ERC-20 tokens.

## Functionality

### Creating Attractions

The contract provides a function to create new attractions within the Disney theme park. The creator of the contract or an authorized entity can add new attractions along with their relevant details, such as name, description, and activation status.

### Activating/Deactivating Attractions

Attractions can be activated and deactivated by the contract owner or authorized parties. Activated attractions are accessible to visitors, while deactivated attractions are temporarily unavailable.

### Food Payment

The contract allows users to make payments for food using the Disney tokens. Visitors can interact with the contract to purchase food items within the theme park.

### Transaction History

The contract keeps track of all client transactions involving attraction activation, deactivation, and food purchases. Clients can view their transaction history to keep track of their token usage within the park.

## Access Control with Modifiers

Modifiers are used to enforce access control restrictions within the contract. Certain functions can only be executed by the contract owner or other authorized addresses. Modifiers help ensure that critical functions are protected from unauthorized access.

## Events

The contract emits events to notify external applications and interfaces about important activities within the theme park. Events are emitted when attractions are activated or deactivated, and when food purchases are made.

## How to Use

To deploy and interact with the Disney Token Manager smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies (list the dependencies and versions if applicable).

2. Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain (provide deployment instructions).

3. Interact with the contract using the provided API or smart contract functions (document the available functions and their parameters).

4. Access the emitted events to stay informed about attraction and food-related activities (subscribe to events and interpret event data).

## Examples

Here are some code snippets to demonstrate how to interact with the contract:

1. **Creating an Attraction:**
```solidity
function createAttraction(string memory name, string memory description) public onlyOwner {
    // Function implementation
}
```

2. **Activating an Attraction:**
```solidity
function activateAttraction(uint256 attractionId) public onlyOwner {
    // Function implementation
}
```

3. **Paying for Food:**
```solidity
function payForFood(uint256 amount) public {
    // Function implementation
}
```

4. **Viewing Transaction History:**
```solidity
function getTransactionHistory(address client) public view returns (Transaction[] memory) {
    // Function implementation
}
```
